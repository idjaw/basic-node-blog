===============

A very simple blog-like behaviour used to learn node, using the express framework and mongodb. 

The behaviour is very simple. Checkout the code, and make sure you have mongodb installed. The code is assuming a localhost instance with default settings. Once mongo is running, simply run the node app with: 

node app.js

Navigate in your browser to localhost:3000/newpost

Fill in the fields, submit, and done.
